# Driver Drowsiness Detection

This project detects driver drowsiness using a webcam by analyzing eye closure and yawning patterns. It utilizes OpenCV, dlib, TensorFlow, and pygame for real-time monitoring and alerts.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Uses dlib's face landmark detection.
- **Eye and Mouth Aspect Ratio Calculation**: Detects drowsiness by analyzing eye closure and yawning.
- **Drowsiness Alert System**: Plays an alarm sound when drowsiness is detected.
- **Live Webcam Monitoring**: Continuously processes video feed to monitor driver's alertness.
